# Geographic analysis of Che Guaveras Diaries: Geographic Informtaion Retrieval 
This project explores geographic information retrieval techniques applied to The Motorcycle Diaries by Che Guevara. I'm building a pipeline that extracts and enriches geographic entities from the text using NLP tools and gazetteers. 
It's still a work in progress, right now I'm focusing on cleaning up the notebook, structuring helper functions, and linking locations with actual coordinates and country data for further analysis and visualization.
