# Geographic analysis of Che Guaveras Diaries: Geographic Informtaion Retrieval 
Geographic Information Retrieval with NLP + Gazetteers

This project explores geographic information retrieval techniques applied to The Motorcycle Diaries by Ernesto Che Guevara. The goal is to build a pipeline that can automatically extract place references from the text, normalize them, and link them to geographic coordinates and country metadata.

It’s part of my BA thesis in Digital Humanities, where I combine computational text analysis with geographic visualization to reconstruct the journey described in the diaries.

Status: Work in progress — currently focusing on cleaning up the notebook, modularizing helper functions, and improving how location mentions are linked with actual coordinates and country data.
